# Paula's personal preferences:
- make some attempt to adhere to SOLID, especially single responsibility/modularity
- always update Docs
- either use a linter or consciously make code spacing nice-looking
- never use abbreviations and err on the side of understandable variable names, even if long (vscode has autocomplete)
- do not commit to master unless 100% sure changes will still run
- only merge after empirical testing
