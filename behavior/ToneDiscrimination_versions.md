# version1:
- no foreperiod

- movement is defined as the passing of two absolute thresholds, noMvtThresh and mvtThresh (wrt MVT0 sampled at the start of the session), within a duration specified in durations.maxLeverPressDuration.
- moving past noMvtThresh during the last second of ITI causes ITI to be extended until no more movement for a second
- no yellow light
- left handside block against lever moving back
- reward delivery click sound
