# version1:
- no foreperiod
- ITI is sampled from a random uniformation distribution set in durations.ITISettings
- movement is defined as the passing of two absolute thresholds, noMvtThresh and mvtThresh (wrt MVT0 sampled at the start of the session), within a duration specified in durations.maxLeverPressDuration.
- __yellow light on throughout ITI__
- __moving past noMvtThresh during the last second of ITI causes ITI to be extended until no more movement__

- movement is defined as the passing of two absolute thresholds, noMvtThresh and mvtThresh (wrt MVT0 sampled at the start of the session), within a duration specified in durations.maxLeverPressDuration.
- __yellow light on throughout ITI__
