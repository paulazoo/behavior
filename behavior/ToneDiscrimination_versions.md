# version1:
- no foreperiod
- ITI is sampled from a random uniformation distribution set in durations.ITISettings
- movement is defined as the passing of two absolute thresholds, noMvtThresh and mvtThresh (wrt MVT0 sampled at the start of the session), within a duration specified in durations.maxLeverPressDuration.
- moving past noMvtThresh during the last second of ITI causes ITI to be extended until no more movement
- no yellow light
- left handside block against lever moving back
- __push down__
- reward delivery click sound


# version2:
