Paula:
- name, organize, and run all recent data for ANA1, ANA2, ANB1, ANB2 through analysis notebooks
- calculate and divide by minimal jerk
- train some WT, headbar mice on Komiyama-based parameters in December: CODE DONE see ./behavior
- ask Arundathi and Sophie about supervision for H2O
- CAC protocol UROP thing
- analysis1: Also consider extracting movements by velocity threshold ->
	then movements are defined by windows with a reward delivery/lever press detection and velocity being above the threshold;
	this would also affect reaction time
- stain brains for c-fos, TH+


- Taylor CAC
- ask Sofie about GCaMP(7?) viral expression

# separate future
show nulls have a deficit, then either elicit NE release behaviorally (punishment sound) or optogenetically
