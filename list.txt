Paula:
- name, organize, and run all recent data for ANA1, ANA2, ANB1, ANB2 through analysis notebooks
- calculate and divide by minimal jerk
- stain brains for c-fos, TH+
- train some WT, headbar mice on Komiyama-based parameters in December: CODE DONE see ./behavior
	- water restricted >= 5 days
	- yellow light on entire ITI, no foreperiod
	- ITI 1st day 2-4s, 2nd day 4-8s, 3rd day 8-12s
	- durDecision 1st day 30s, 2nd day 10s
	- fake image leading up to 4th day, only image 4th day, then fake image leading up to last day, only image last day

	- try: turning lever sideways and having mice push downwards
	- try: add a reward tone at water delivery
	- try: having a flat platform for left arm
	- try: add a white noise for misses
	- try for better analysis: increase threshold to 1.5mm past first threshold
