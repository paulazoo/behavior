Paula:
- write CAC protocol UROP thing
- train 4 WT, headbar mice on Komiyama-based parameters: see ./behavior/ToneDiscrimination_versions.md
- ask Arundathi and Sophie about supervision for H2O

future experiments:
- show nulls have a deficit, then either elicit NE release behaviorally (punishment sound) or optogenetically
- stain brains for c-fos, TH+
- pupil video synchronization and DLC pipeline

- Also consider extracting movements by velocity threshold ->
	then movements are defined by windows with a reward delivery/lever press detection and velocity being above the threshold;
	this would also affect reaction time
